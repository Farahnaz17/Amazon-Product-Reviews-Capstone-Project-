Ask

Problem Statement:  
How can Amazon and third-party sellers better understand review trends, product performance, and customer sentiment to improve sales and customer satisfaction?
ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source**: Amazon product reviews dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Cleaning Steps**:
  - Removed duplicate/missing reviews.  
  - Created calculated fields (review length, word count, rating category, price tier).  
  - Standardized product pricing into tiers (Budget, Midrange, Premium).  
  - Extracted date-based fields (review month, year) for trend analysis.  

Final dataset: W1466 after cleaning.

Key Insights
- Ratings vs Price: Premium products have higher ratings on average, but lower review volume.  
- Review Length: Longer reviews correlate with lower ratings, indicating customer dissatisfaction is explained in detail.  
- Review Trends Over Time: Spikes in reviews during seasonal shopping months (Novâ€“Dec).  
- Top Products: A few products account for the majority of revenue and review activity.  

 Recommendations
1. Product Tier Strategy  
   - Market Premium products based on strong ratings.  
   - Monitor Budget/Midrange products with lower reviews for quality improvements.  

2. Customer Feedback Loops  
   - Use insights from long, low-rated reviews to address recurring product issues.  

3. Seasonal Campaigns  
   - Prepare marketing pushes before seasonal peaks (holidays, sales events).
